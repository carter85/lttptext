## Dungeon Entrance
"You finish climbing the stairs. To either side are the massive leonine statues, above is the top of the temple, out of reach. Ahead is the dark entrance to the temple."
### Options
Forward - Enter dungeon
Left, Right, Up - No way
Backward - Descend stairs
## Room A - Dungeon Entryroom.
"You enter the dungeon into a dimly-lit room. Ahead are 2 statues of large cyclopsian beings. There is a short path directly ahead ending at a closed door. There are paths to the left and right, both also with closed doors. Each passage contains a pot to the side of the passageway."
## Room B - Bridge Room
"You pass through the door into a large room lit with lanterns. You find yourself on a bridge spanning the length of the room, with a very deep drop off underneath, the bottom of which is not visible.
On the bridge are 3 Popo's, sentient masses of tentacles, who do not seem to take notice of you. There is a tile sticking up slightly about halfway across the bridge."
## Room C - Ball Room
"You enter the new room. There is a near constant mechanical sound and what seems like a heavy object sliding on sand coming from further in the room, as well as a slight rumbling.
You are on a raised portion of the room, the platform you're on has more cyclopean statues, one at each end, as well as stairs leading down from the ledge your on.
Across the gap in an alcove you can see some pots surrounding a chest."
